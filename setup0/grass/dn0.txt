	setup0/ folder.

        grass/   (Grasspatch environent)

	GUI application to setup the system.
	It's runs using the kgws window server,
	embedded inside the base kernel.

	Raw blue windows.

	Maybe all these apps could run in it's own desktop and
	have it's own user session.


        ----
        We need to close the 'setup system'
        to initializes the user environment. Just like the BIOS system.

        The goal is that the setup system is the only system that uses the
        libcore/ library, so we can change its name to libsu/
